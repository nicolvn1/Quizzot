Finals suck, huh? Studying is tedious and during the final weeks of the quarter, we are completely drained of all our motivation. Instead of paying attention during class, you are sit in the back of the lecture hall, hood up, playing type racer with your friends to stay awake. I'm sure someone can relate haha. Rather than wasting time and losing brain cells mindlessly typing, you can play our game Zot Racer instead!

Zot Racer revamps studying and motivates students to finish the quarter strong. In the game, you, the lovely Anteater, are placed head to head to our favorite Starship Zotbot!



How to Play

1. Select a set of practice questions that you want to review, or create your own set.

2. After you selected your set, press the big "Play" button!

3. Press the start button to begin answering questions. A question will appear below the race track. Much like Type Racer, your avatar advances with each correct answer.

4. After solving the question, click "New Question" to receive the next one. You can also skip to the next question by clicking "Next Question," but will eventually have to answer all questions from the set to finish the race.

Try to get to the other side of the screen before the zotbot!
